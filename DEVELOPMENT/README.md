# How to create a new "Use case" example

1. Create a new workspace in Tinybird using the UI and choose to use the `Web Analytics` Template. This will generate a new Workspace and push all the resources from the Web Analytics template
2. Create a repository in Github (private or public)
3. Connect the workspace with the repository using the [documentation about versions](https://www.tinybird.co/docs/production/working-with-version-control#connect-your-workspace-to-git-from-the-cli)
4. At this point, you should have a workspace connected to Git and using the release 0.0.0
5. (Optional) You can use `mockingbird` to start fake data to our workspace. Just go to https://mockingbird.tinybird.co/ and follow the steps to start sending data to your workspace
6. (Optional) You can run the script `utils/query_api.sh` to generate fake requests to the endpoints of the workspace
